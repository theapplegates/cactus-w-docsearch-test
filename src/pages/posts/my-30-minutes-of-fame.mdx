Here is some trivia about me. When I was 10 we lived in New Jersey. My mother was in the process of becoming a contestant on the $20,000 Pyramid.She was taken aside and asked if she wanted to appear on the $20,000 Junior Pyramid. From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became Junior Partner Pyramid, which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative.

If youâ€™re curious what TV was like in 1979 then be all means watch the [episode](https://vimeo.com/26595314) the password is pa$$word. Oh and I lost the game.
